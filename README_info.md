# Web-chat_project
This is an online web chat application using socket.io and nodejs.
Hello guys!!! 
================================
Some information:
This projects intention was basically the usage of socket.io (how to build CONNECTION between a client and the server..)
Yeah the css could be made better and the website could be made responsive maybe later I might make it responsive(too lazy to add a media query tag tbh xD)

*I use ejs as my template engine in my backend.*

*this project was for my practice while I was in my learning phase*
